### Known Issues 
##### Bug: Song Slider Moving Too Fast


- **Bug Description:** I've identified an issue with the song slider in GrooveZone that causes it to move too quickly when the next or previous button is pressed.

- **Steps to Reproduce:** To encounter this bug, follow these steps:
  1. Start playing a song.
  2. Press the next or previous button to switch to another song.
